OUR COMPANY: A company of 2 strong and launched in May 2019 by brothers 
Nick and Dan Hunnewell. Their mission, bringing better coffee to Amazon 
while giving back to coffee growing regions.
LIGHT ROAST COFFEE: This is an extremely sweet and delicate coffee. Weâ€™ve 
found that this roast makes an incredible espresso, as well as a 
beautiful, bright drip coffee.
ARABICA COFFEE: Our blends are made from 100% Arabica coffee beans. 
Arabica Coffee has twice the flavor and a better aroma than its 
counterpart Robusta.
FLAVOR FIRST: We source all our coffee to achieve specific taste notes. 
Our Light Roast Coffee Beans tastes of Honey, Citrus Fruit, and Floral 
with a crisp and silky body, a perfect Breakfast Blend.

you'll be in love. If for any reason you are not 100% satisfied with your 
purchase, give us a shout and we'll make it right. You'll get to talk 
directly to one of the two Coffee Bros when you reach out to us. Dan is 
the Head of Brand and Marketing while Nick is our Head Roaster. We'll help
